This web app gives Vadio partners the ability to review data analytics for their video content channels. The UI is an interface to Vadio's Analytics API and provides data visualization of key metrics and timeframes. Users can view metrics over a number of graphs that dynamically update based on the channels selected. The aggregation panel gives a quick view of total metrics and trends against the previous period. Under the hood, the application is React with Redux, Chartjs, Webpack, Sass, and Typescript.

Users can view key metrics across multiple visualizations. Say, the number of sessions over the last 7 days.

Graphs can be toggled on and off to focus on the those most important to the user.

Users can toggle groups or individual channels and switch between metrics.

The user can view key metrics against a range of hourly, daily, and monthly timeframes.

The Aggregations Panel provides totals and averages for the user's selected channels and timeframe. Each aggregate displays the change over the previous period.
