Jaguar Land Rover is a member of the Automotive Grade Linux Open Source group and a contributor of innovative applications for In-Vehicle systems.
 
This Style Guide represents the common design and functional components of a suite of mobile applications for the user on the go.
 


A thorough typography section walks designers through HTML headings, presentational elements, and semantic modifier classes.

These sliders are made with range input elements and a lot of custom CSS. All the properties are sized in ems, making the sliders scalable with a simple font-size change.

These A/B toggle switches use SVGs for scalabilty and Javascript for toggling states.

More custom CSS delivered scrollbars that suited the UI design. Scrolling classes help control scrollbar and overflow visibility while improving touch behavior.

Mapping new text styles to old ones improved clean-up of unnecessarily verbose and complicated legacy code.

Large swatches provide easy reference to color specs and available classes.

Flex properties helped control column sizing and made customization more... um... flexible.

Flex again saved the day by giving inline form elements some much-needed structure.

Modules, Widgets, Boxes. Call it what you will, they come in handy for separating sections of content.

It's important for designers to write usable, meaningful, easy-to-read code. The Google HTML/CSS Style Guide kicked us off with the essential best practices.

The Style Guide will continue to grow as design is enhanced and new products and features lead to new adventures in standardization.
