This manufacturer of coin-operated amusements aimed to show-up the competition with a product line that could outshine, outperform, and outlast. So I gave the brand and product identities an attitude that reflected it’s high level of performance. In addition to these identities, I also designed product literature, a website, and table graphics. I also had the pleasure of naming all the individual products.
