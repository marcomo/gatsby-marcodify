## Proof-of-Concept Prototype

Starting with Navit, an open source navigation system, I designed an enhanced user experience and interface based on Navitâ€™s fundamental features. The app centralizes many of the Navit features to the map view to give the user a more seamless interaction and a focus on navigating streets not menus.

I served as the design and UX point person working with our dev team to see this built as a functional prototype which we successfully ran on-board on the road.

The main map view gives the user the ability to navigate the map, select locations, search, get their position, and change their view orientation.

The user can get a route to a location and initiate navigation.

The navigation view provides the user with step-by-step written directions, detailed route information, and the ability to add a waypoint to the route.

When the user selects a new location while en route, they're given the option to start a new route or add the location as a waypoint on the existing route.

Users can toggle between 2D and 3D views.

Users can search available maps and download only those maps they need.

The user is provided with a list of recommended maps based on their current location.
