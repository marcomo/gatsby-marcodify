## Proof-of-Concept Prototype

This fully-featured email client for the connected traveller provides an experience on par with competing smartphone clients. It features multiple accounts, full screen composition, search, and conversation views. I provided the UI design, developed the HTML, CSS, and Javascript interactions and contributed to the UX design. The application was contributed to Open Source through the Automative Grade Linux project.

## Use Cases

Edit Account Settings Use Case, HMI Flow: Users can manage multiple accounts — adding, deleting or changing the password.

The email application supports multiple accounts on the IMAP protocol. The user can add accounts, switch between accounts and update account passwords from the Account Settings screen.

The inbox interface includes a mini sidebar that expands to a full menu with access to frequently used features including switching folders, switching accounts, seeing unread counts and syncing the app to the email service.

The email application provides the user with brief, unobtrusive confirmations and feedback on several actions including sending and deleting emails

Send New Email Use Case, HMI Flow: The user has full control over recipients with an expanding cc/bcc option. And new email drafts are automatically stored in the user's drafts folder.

The user can reply, reply-all, forward, cc and bcc any email. The email thread is displayed in conversation view with the ability to expand any part of the email conversation.
