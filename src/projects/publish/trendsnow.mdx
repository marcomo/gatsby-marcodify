## Overview

Trends Now was developed to help the customers at Ingrooves—label managers, artists, and music industry
professionals—discover how their music is performing across a number of streaming retailers and territories.
At the time of its creation, an analytics tool already existed but only provided raw data; it gave no insightful
analysis into the data or any actionable recommendations. And it was painfully slow and buggy due to a lack of
people resources and outdated technology.

<Grid lgrows={1} lgcolumns={2} mdrows={2} mdcolumns={1} className="cols-30-70 rows-70-30">
  <div className="hide-on-mobile">
    <div className="gridarea-1">

      </Image>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div className="gridarea-2">

    We had a simple model:

    - Give meaningful insights
    - Support those insights with data
    - Promote action

    We had the data but not the insights or actions. The insights were being developed by
    the data science team and the actions—by way of an ad platform—were being developed by
    the marketing product team. Trends Now would bring it all together.

## My Role

I came on as a contractor in 2017, having done music analytics previously. Ingrooves needed someone
who could handle design and development and move quickly. I was the sole frontend developer and
product designer on the project for the first two years. I was then joined by another frontend
developer to tackle code while I focused more on user experience and new features.

In the early MVP stage, I worked directly with the Head of Product and the CTO. A dedicated team
eventually developed and I worked alongside a Product Manager, Data Scientists, and Engineers.

I also partnered with Designers and Engineers on the marketing team to integrate Trends Now with
the ad platform being built.

## Features

<Territories id="territories">

    ### Territories

    #### Challenge

    Users wanted to know how their songs were doing in specific
    countries and have the ability to filter by other dimensions. What started
    off as a massive table in MVP turned into an approachable interactive map
    visualization.

    #### Wants

    - How is my song performing in a specific country
    - Which countries are performing best
    - Which countries have the greatest improvement
    - Which retailers are performing best for my song

    #### Highlights

    - Focus on one, many, or all territories
    - Fully responsive down to iPhone 5
    - Map view gives the user the quickest way to observe trend volume
    - Table view allows the user to rank and sort
    - Territory search gives the user a short path to finding places that are hard to spell or locate

</Territories>

### Search

<Search id="search">

    #### Challenge

    Song, artist, and label names are creative and run the gamut.
    The user needed to be able to differentiate between them quickly.

    #### Wants

    - Access specific content types; it's not always about a song
    - Find the best performing content first
    - Be able to search with more than words, like song ID
    - Quickly revisit previous content
    - An easy-to-explore mobile experience

    #### Highlights

    - Results are categorized so users can focus in before or after doing their search
    - Full-screen results for maximum readability
    - Results are ordered and styled to show trending content first matching their design in the main view
    - Search comes preloaded with recent searches
    - Searching by label or song ID also works

</Search>

### On the Move

<OnTheMove id="sotm">

    #### Challenge

    Ingrooves uses AI to analyze trending data and identify drivers of continuing growth.
    When paired with social data, an audience can be created and labels can promote their artists
    through ads.

    There are various levels of growth, so we needed to create styling and language that told
    the songs story in phases while emphasizing marketing opportunities.

    #### Wants

    - Highlight songs that can be promoted immediately
    - Hightlight songs that are in a growth phase and give attribution
    - Show the growth history of the song to identify patterns that can be useful for understanding other song behavior

    #### Highlights

    - On the Move songs are surfaced before all other content
    - Smart Audience opportunities are emphasized most
    - Song growth is backed by attribution and noted on preview card
    - Song view expands to a timeline view where users can traverse historic drivers
