    Trends Now was developed to help the customers at Ingrooves&#8212;label managers, artists, and music industry
    professionals&#8212;discover how their music is performing across a number of streaming retailers and territories.

    The existing analytics product was outdated and lacked many features needed to compete with competitors.

<Concept id="progression">

    ### Concept

    The initial concept was to have actionable insights supported by data. 'Trend' cards would be presented in views by user, label, artist, or song alongside high-level aggregations. Over the span of 4 years, I iterated the design and developed the UI to make it more engaging and to better align with user wants.

</Concept>

## Features

<Territories id="territories">

    #### Challenge

    Users wanted to know how each of their songs was performing in specific
    countries, retailers, and timeframes.

    #### Solution

    The MVP design had all the data but no sizzle. It evolved into an interactive map
    visualization for desktop and mobile where the user could progress through the data like a story.

</Territories>

<Search id="search">

    #### Challenge

    Song, artist, and label names are creative and run the gamut.
    The user needed to be able to differentiate between them quickly.

    #### Solution

    I started with a traditional lookup search in a dropdown list but there's only so much you can show before the user is overwhelmed. So I expanded search to the full window giving us room to better categorize and highlight results.

</Search>

<OnTheMove id="sotm">

    #### Challenge

    Ingrooves uses AI to analyze trending data and identify drivers of continuing growth.
    There are various stages of growth so a styling system was needed to handle varying messaging and emphasize high-value insights.

    #### Solution

    Songs with marketing opportunities get the greatest emphasis while browsing through all trending songs is made easier by paging and scrolling.
