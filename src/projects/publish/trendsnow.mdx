## Overview

<Grid lgrows={2} lgcolumns={2} mdrows={3} mdcolumns={1} className="rows-auto cols-60-40 no-figure-margins no-row-gaps">
  <div className="gridarea-2">

    The goal was to replace the existing outdated analytics product with a new insight-centric product that drove marketing actions through AI-powered data analysis.
    The core of the app was a series of 'Trend' cards presented in views by user, label, artist, or song alongside high-level aggregations.

  </div>

  <div className="gridarea-1">

    Trends Now was developed to help the customers at Ingrooves&#8212;label managers, artists, and music industry
    professionals&#8212;discover how their music is performing across a number of streaming retailers and territories.
    I built the UI design, frontend, and API from the ground up.

  </div>

</Grid>

## Features

### Territories

<Territories id="territories">

    #### Challenge

    Users wanted to know how each of their songs was performing in specific
    countries, retailers, and timeframes.

    #### Solution

    An interactive map visualization for desktop and mobile allowed users to explore broad and granular data metrics. User can toggle retailers, countries, and date ranges to home in on the insights they seek.

    #### Prototype


    <div className="mt-2">
      <IframeEmbed
        src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/798552596?h=8a887f8af1&byline=0&portrait=0'
      />
    </div>

</Territories>

### Search

<Search id="search">

    #### Challenge

    Song, artist, and label names are creative and run the gamut.
    The user needed to be able to differentiate between them quickly.

    #### Solution

    A full window search gave us room to better communicate results to users by categorizing, sorting by significance, leveraging artwork, and including search history.

    #### Prototype

    <div className="mt-2">
      <IframeEmbed
        src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/777512579?h=bbfbb0be52&byline=0&portrait=0'
      />
    </div>

</Search>

### On the Move

<OnTheMove id="sotm">

    #### Challenge

    Ingrooves uses AI to analyze trending data and identify drivers of continuing growth.
    There are various stages of growth so a styling system was needed to handle varying messaging and emphasize high-value insights.

    #### Solution

    Songs with marketing opportunities get the greatest emphasis while browsing through all trending songs is made easier by paging and scrolling.
