# Overview

Navigation is standard functionality and the most widely used application of <span className="text-no-wrap">in-vehicle</span> infotainment (IVI). Jaguar Land Rover contributes software to <ExternalLink href="https://www.automotivelinux.org/">an open source project</ExternalLink> as part of its research and development. This project provided a base navigation app that could be developed for an IVI system or peer-to-peer device.

We started with <ExternalLink href="https://www.navit-project.org/">Navit</ExternalLink>, an open-source navigation system built on <ExternalLink href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMaps</ExternalLink>. While Navit served as a good framework for development, it lacked an engaging and simple user experience. The map was quite difficult to read and many tasks required deep menu drilling to be completed. I centralized key Navit features into the main map view, and reduced menu fatigue by using expanding lists and toggle switches.
