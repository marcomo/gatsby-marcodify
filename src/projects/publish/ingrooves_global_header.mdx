## Overview

Ingrooves has quickly developed new products offering over the years to better serve their music label clients and grow the business. But with the addition of these products came a lot of confusion for customers about where to find various tools and resources throughout the Ingrooves product environment.

The purpose of this project was to redesign the universal navigation model and interface so that users would have easier access to and a better mental model of our product family.

## Previous navigation

<Grid rows={1} columns={2} className="cols-40-60">
  <div className="gridarea-1">

    - Products are split into three groupings at the top level <small>(white fill)</small>
    - Products are nested within those groupings <small>(blue outlines)</small>
    - Some product groups are actually products <small>(white fill with blue outlines)</small>
    - Many items in the menu are product features <small>(green outlines)</small>
    - Not all products listed are links, some are just nesting levels

  </div>
  <div className="gridarea-2">
    <Image caption="Previous universal navigation model" includeShadow={false}>
      ![Previous universal navigation
      model](../../images/ingrooves/productnav/prev_universal_navigation_model.png)
    </Image>
  </div>
</Grid>

### Issues

Current users were frustrated by the nesting of products especially where there was enough room for a flat list.
They also noted there was a lack of labeling across many product pages. This made it difficult for users to remember
and differentiate products. Another frustration we heard was that users couldn't see other product grouping menus
without first visiting those products. That's because each grouping only shows its own branch of the navigation.

## New Navigation

<Grid rows={1} columns={2} className="cols-60-40">
  <div className="gridarea-1">
    <Image caption="New universal navigation model" includeShadow={false}>
      ![New universal navigation
      model](../../images/ingrooves/productnav/new_universal_navigation_model.png)
    </Image>
  </div>
  <div className="gridarea-2">

    A few things changed within the business that mostly made things a bit easier:

    - Some products were sunsetted
    - Some product features evolved into independent offerings
    - Some new features were added

    The new navigation model:

    - Allows users to see the entire product suite from any product
    - Commits to a common language for names tha display on products and features
    - Reduces the number of levels to two
    - Allows features in the second level in place of products depending on the groupings needs

  </div>
</Grid>

## New Navigation Menu

<Grid rows={1} columns={2} className="cols-40-60">
  <div className="gridarea-1">
    <Image caption="New product menus" showCaption>
      ![New product menus](../../images/ingrooves/productnav/product_menus.png)
    </Image>
  </div>
  <div className="gridarea-2">
    <Image caption="Previous navigation menus" includeShadow={false} showCaption>
      ![Previous navigation
      menus](../../images/ingrooves/productnav/old_menus.png)
    </Image>

    <div className="mt-4">

      The new side-only navigation:

      - Can be collapsed to conserve space for working or mobile
      - Gives us room for supporting text to help users understand product groupings
      - Assigns icons to products to better connect menus to product pages
      - Contains both the universal and product-specific menus
      - Frees up topmost horizontal space in the main UI for product-specific content and tertiary menus

    </div>

  </div>
</Grid>
