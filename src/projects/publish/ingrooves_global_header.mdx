## Overview

<Grid lgrows={2} lgcolumns={2} mdrows={2} mdcolumns={1} className="rows-auto no-figure-margins no-row-gaps">
  <div className="gridarea-1">

    Ingrooves has quickly developed new products over the years to better
    serve their music label clients and grow the business. These new products
    were only accessible through specific product categories making it
    difficult to know where to find things.

  </div>
  <div className="gridarea-2">

    The purpose of this project was to redesign the universal navigation
    model and interface so that users would have faster access to products
    and a better mental model of the entire Ingrooves product family.

  </div>
</Grid>

## Previous navigation

<Grid lgrows={1} lgcolumns={2} mdrows={2} mdcolumns={1} className="lg-cols-40-60 thick-row-gaps">
  <div className="gridarea-1">
{/* 
    - Products are split into three groupings at the top level <small>(white fill)</small>
    - Products are nested within those groupings <small>(blue outlines)</small>
    - Some product groups are actually products <small>(white fill with blue outlines)</small>
    - Many items in the menu are product features <small>(green outlines)</small>
    - Not all products listed are links, some are just nesting levels */}

    ### Issues

    - <span className='box-outline-blue'>Products</span> only accessible from certain products pages
    - Products acting as <span className='box-fill-white'>categories</span>
    - Product <span className='box-outline-green'>features</span> seeming to be products
    - Product pages not displaying their name or having different names than menu

  </div>
  <div className="gridarea-2">

      ![Previous universal navigation
      model](../../images/ingrooves/productnav/prev_universal_navigation_model.png)
    </Image>
  </div>
</Grid>

## New Navigation

<Grid lgrows={1} lgcolumns={2} mdrows={2} mdcolumns={1} className="cols-60-40 rows-auto thick-row-gaps">
  <div className="gridarea-1">
    <Image caption="New universal navigation model" includeShadow={false} className="no-figure-margins">
      ![New universal navigation
      model](../../images/ingrooves/productnav/new_universal_navigation_model.png)
    </Image>
  </div>
  <div className="gridarea-2">

    ### Improvements

    Some new products and features were added while others were retired. With that, a new navigation model was designed that:

    - Allows users to see the entire product suite from any product
    - Uses a common language for names that display on products and features
    - Reduces the number of nesting levels to reduce navigation fatigue
    - Puts features as top-level navigation within products

  </div>
</Grid>

## New Navigation Menu

<Grid lgrows={1} lgcolumns={2} mdrows={2} mdcolumns={1} className="lg-cols-40-60" >
  <div className="gridarea-1">
    <Image caption="New product menus" showCaption className="mdx-image">
      ![New product menus](../../images/ingrooves/productnav/product_menus.png)
    </Image>
  </div>
  <div className="gridarea-2">
    <div className="hide-on-mobile">
      <Image caption="Previous navigation menus" includeShadow={false} showCaption>
        ![Previous navigation
        menus](../../images/ingrooves/productnav/old_menus.png)
      </Image>
    </div>

    <div className="mt-4">

      The new side-only navigation:

      - Can be collapsed to conserve space for working or mobile
      - Gives us room for supporting text to help users understand product categories
      - Assigns icons to products to better connect menus to product pages
      - Contains both the universal and product-specific menus
      - Frees up topmost horizontal space in the main UI for product-specific content and tertiary menus

    </div>

  </div>
</Grid>
